#+title: Xilinx KRIA KV260

* Introduction

* Build instructions
On a moderately recent Ubuntu-base distribution, the following packages seemed to be required to build the
report:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo apt-get install texlive-base texlive-latex-recommended texlive-lang-japanese
#+END_SRC

Then, the actual build can be made with a simple:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  pdflatex instructions.tex
#+END_SRC

No fancy Lua or theme at the moment !

* Automatic build with CI/CD pipeline
If you don't want to build the report yourself, a CI pipeline is used to make it on GitLab.

You can check the steps in the .gitlab-ci.yml file.
This build uses a base Ubuntu image and basically takes the same steps as presented above for a local build.

A PDF artifact can be downloaded.
