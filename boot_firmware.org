The goal for the Linux side of the deployment is to
have the latest LTS version of Ubuntu up and running.

In order to be able to boot such a newer version of Linux, the
boot image of the board must first be updated.

The procedure is available in the official documentation[fn:2],
but I will present it step by step here.

** Getting the new firmware
A 2022.2 version of the board firmware is best in order to run the latest
version of Ubuntu or PetaLinux properly.

The image download link can be obtained at the Atlassian page[fn:1] on the topic,
in the table detailing what version is best suited for which board.

In our case, we want to access this[fn:3] page. AMD login will be asked, then
download of firmware can be done.

** Reaching the board recovery tool
Now the firmware ~.bin~ image is available[fn:4], it is possible to update it using the
boards recovery tool. Here are the steps that must be taken in order to reach
this tool and update the board:

+ Power off the board and hold the firmware update button (FWUEN) when powering back the board.
+ Connect the board to your machine via a Ethernet cable.
  This will obviously cut you internet access, so you should be set for that.
+ In the case of the KR260, the bottom right port should be used, as seen in the
  figure [[fig:krport]] below.
+ Select the wired network as your connection (must be "forced", since it
  doesn't have internet access). To do so, you should disable the IPv6, and set
  the IPv4 as manual, as visible in the figure [[fig:ipv4set]] hereafter.
+ Set a fixed IP address for your machine, in the ~192.168.0.2/24~
  range, except the specific ~192.168.0.111~, which will be used by the
  board, and ~192.168.0.1~ which is the DNS and gateway.
  The netmask and gateway should also be respectively set to
  ~255.255.255.0~ and ~192.168.0.1~.
+ Unplug the board power cord again. Hold the firmware update button (FWUEN)
  when powering back the board.
+ Using a web browser on your host machine, access ~http://192.168.0.111~. Thou
  shall now see the interface, as visible on the figure [[fig:recovery]] below. If
  the page struggle to appear, you should try to un-plug and re-plug the
  Ethernet cable.

** Updating the boot firmware
From this "recovery" page, it is possible to upload the ~.bin~ file downloaded previously onto
the board using the "Recover Image" section at the bottom right of the page.

The board can be re-booted afterwards.
