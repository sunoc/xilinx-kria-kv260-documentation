* Boot firmware
The goal for the Linux side of the deployment is to
have the latest LTS version of Ubuntu up and running.

In order to be able to boot such a newer version of Linux, the
boot image of the board must first be updated.

The procedure is available in [[https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug1089-kv260-starter-kit/Firmware-Update][the official documentation]],
but I will present it step by step here.

** Getting the new firmware
A 2022 version of the board firmware is required in order to run the latest
version of Ubuntu properly.

The image can be downloaded at [[https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/1641152513/Kria+K26+
SOMoot-FW-update-with-xmutil][the atlassian page]] on the topic,
or even directly with the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  wget https://www.xilinx.com/member/forms/download/\
       design-license-xef.html?filename=BOOT-k26-starter-kit-20230516185703.bin
#+END_SRC


** Reaching the board recovery tool
Now the firmware ~.bin~ image is available, it is possible to update it using the
boards recovery tool. Here are the steps that must be taken in order to reach
this tool and update the board:

+ Connect the board to your machine via a Ethernet cable.
  This will obviously cut you internet access, so you should be set for that.
+ Select the wired network as your connection (must be "forced", since it
  doesn't have internet access).
+ Set a fixed IP address for your machine, in the ~192.168.0.1/24~
  range, except the specific ~192.168.0.111~, which will be used by the
  board.
  The netmark and gateway should also be respectively set to
  ~255.255.255.0~ and ~192.168.0.1~.
+ Hold the firmware update button (FWUEN) when powering back the board.
+ Using a web browser on your host machine, access
  ~http://192.168.0.111~. Thou shall now see the interface, as visible on
  the figure [[fig:recovery]] below. If the page struggle to appear,
you should try to un-plug and re-plug the Ethernet cable.

** Updating the boot firmware
From this "recovery" page, it is possible to upload the ~.bin~ file downloaded previously onto
the board using the "Recover Image" section at the bottom right of the page.

The board can be re-booted afterwards.
