\section{Boot Image Update}
\label{sec:boot-image-update}
In order to be able to boot a newer version of Linux, the
boot image of the board must be updated.

The procedure is available in \href{https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug1089-kv260-starter-kit/Firmware-Update}{the official documentation},
but I will present it step by step here.

\subsection{Getting the new firmware}
\label{sec:getting-new-firmware}
A 2022 version of the board firmware is required in order to run the latest version of Ubuntu properly.

The image can be downloaded at \href{https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/1641152513/Kria+K26+SOM#Boot-FW-update-with-xmutil}{the atlassian page on the topic}.

\subsection{Reaching the board recovery tool}
\label{sec:reach-board-recov}
Now the firmware image is available, it is possible to update it using the boards recovery tool.
Here are the steps that must be taken in order to reach this tool and update the board:

\begin{itemize}
\item Connect the board to you machine via Ethernet.
\item Select the wired network as you connection (must be ``forced'', since it doesn't have internet access).
\item Set a fixed IP address for your machine, in the \verb|192.168.0.1/24| range, except the specific \verb|192.168.0.111|, which will be used by the board.
\item Using a web browser on your host machine, access \url{http://192.168.0.111}. You should now see the interface, as visible on the figure \ref{fig:recovery} below.
\item Now the downloaded file can be uploaded as a recovery image in the bottom-right section.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{The recovery tool for the board, access from Firefox. We can see board information at the center, and the tools to upload the firmware at the bottom of the page.}
  \label{fig:recovery}
\end{figure}



%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Ubuntu 22.04}
\label{sec:ubuntu-22.04}
\href{https://ubuntu.com/download/amd-xilinx}{An official Ubuntu image} is provided by Xilinx that allows the OS installation to be quick and
straightforward. Ubuntu is a common and easy to use distribution. Furthermore, it allows to install ROS2 as a package, which is most convenient
and will be done later in this guide.

One the image has been downloaded at Canonical's page (\url{https://ubuntu.com/download/amd-xilinx}), we can flash it onto the SD card.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!5!white,colframe=red!75!black]
  WARNING: The next part involve the \verb|dd| command writing on disks!!! \\
  As always with the dd command, you have to be VERY careful on what arguments you give. Selecting the wrong disk will result on the destruction of your data !! \\
  \textbf{If you are unsure of what to do, seek assistance !}
\end{tcolorbox}


With the image available on you machine and a SD card visible as \verb|/dev/sda|\footnote{Again, it is critical to be 100\% certain that you are working with the correct device!}, one can simply run the \verb|dd| command as follow to write the image to a previously formatted drive (here \verb|/dev/sda|):
\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{verbatim}
sudo dd if=iot-limerick-kria-classic-desktop-2204-x07-\
20230302-63.img of=/dev/sda status=progress bs=8M && sync
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

Once the SD card was flash, put back on the board and a micro-USB cable has been connected from the PC to the board, it is possible to
connect to the board in serial with an appropriate tool, for example picocom, as in the following example:
\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{verbatim}
sudo picocom /dev/ttyUSB1 -b 115200
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

Once logged in, it is typically easier and more convenient to connect the board using SSH.
When the board is connected to the network, it is possible to know it's IP address with
the \verb|ip| command; then it is possible to connect to the board with ssh, as follow (example):
\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{verbatim}
kria# ip -a

host# ssh ubuntu@192.168.4.11
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Proxy and DNS}
\label{sec:proxy-dns}
An issue that can occur when connecting the board to the internet is the conflicting situation with
the school proxy.
Indeed, as the network at Nanzan University requires to go through a proxy, some DNS errors appeared.

Firstly, it is possible to set a DNS IP address in \verb|/etc/resolv.conf| by editing it and adding your favorite DNS, for example \verb|nameserver 1.1.1.1|
next to the other \verb|nameserver| entry.
\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{verbatim}
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

Secondly, it might become needed to setup the proxy for the school.

This can be done as follow, by exporting a https base proxy configuration containing you AXIA credentials, then
by consolidating the configuration for other types of connections in the \verb|bashrc|:
\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{verbatim}
export https_proxy="http://<AXIA_username>:\
<AXIA_psw>@proxy.ic.nanzan-u.ac.jp:8080"
echo "export http_proxy=\""$https_proxy"\"" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export https_proxy=\""$https_proxy"\"" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export ftp_proxy=\""$https_proxy"\"" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export no_proxy=\"localhost, 127.0.0.1,::1\"" \
>> ~/.bashrc
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Starting remoteproc}
\label{sec:starting-remoteproc}
One of the advantage of this board, as cited previously, is the presence of
multiple types of core (APU, MCU, FPGA) on the same chip.

The part we are focusing in this guide is the usage of both the APU, running
a Linux distribution and ROS2; and the MCU, running FreeRTOS and micro-ROS.

The communication between both side is meant to be done using shared memory, but
some extra setup is required.
This section will present how to setup and use as an example the \verb|remoteproc|
and RPMsg system.

\subsection{References}
\label{sec:referances}
This exact use-case is not exactly presented in the official documentation, but some
guides were found to eventually put together this procedure.

\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://speakerdeck.com/fixstars/fpga-seminar-12-fixstars-corporation-20220727}{A slideshow (JP) from Fixstar employees} presents how
  to use the device tree to enable the communication between the cores.
\item \href{https://zenn.dev/ryuz88/articles/kv260_setup_memo_ubuntu22}{This blog article (JP)} shows all the major steps on how to enable the \verb|remoteproc|.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{DTO patching}
\label{sec:dto-patching}
The communication system and interaction from the Linux side towards the real-time capable core
is not enabled by default within the Ubuntu image provided by Xilinx.

Because of that, some modification of the device tree is required in order to have
the \verb|remoteproc| system to start.

Firstly, we need to get the original firmware device tree, converted
into a readable format (DTS):
\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{verbatim}
sudo dtc /sys/firmware/fdt 2> /dev/null > system.dts
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

Then we can download and apply the patch that will allow us to use the \verb|remoteproc|:
\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{verbatim}
wget https://gitlab.com/sunoc/xilinx-kria-kv260-\
documentation/-/raw/main/src/system.patch
patch system.dts < system.patch
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

Now the DTS file has been modified, one can regenerate the binary and place it on the \verb|/boot| partition
and reboot the board:
\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{verbatim}
dtc -I dts -O dtb system.dts -o user-override.dtb
sudo mv user-override.dtb /boot/firmware/
sudo reboot now
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

After rebooting, you can check the content of the \verb|remoteproc| system directory,
and a \verb|remoteproc0| device should be visible, as follow:
\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{verbatim}
ls /sys/class/remoteproc/
#  remoteproc0
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

If it is the case, it means that the patch was successful and RPMsg is
ready to test with some example.

\subsection{Fan PWM control}
\label{sec:fan-pwm-control}
An issue that appeared with the DTO was the PWM regulation for the board fan.

Indeed, this system is, in the recent version of Ubuntu, managed by default
by the operating system, but it appeared that this system was not working anymore
after applying some DTO for the \verb|remoteproc|.

As it turned out, some malformation of the element in the DTS file (some nodes were
at the ``wrong'' place in the file) disabled the starting for the \verb|fan_pwm|
node. Some other weird errors appeared at the time.

With the latest version of the patch that is used in this guide, it is now
possible to have our DTO enabling the \verb|remoteproc| while keeping
the \verb|fan_pwm| enabled.




\subsection{Ping-pong example}
\label{sec:ping-pong-example}
The goal of this part is to have a program running on the Linux side that would
send messages to the real-time core through RPMsg, get some rely back and display
them.

\section{ROS2}
\label{sec:ros2}
As an Ubuntu distribution is installed on the board, the installation of ROS2 can be done
in a standard way, using the repository.

An \href{https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html}{official documentation}
is provided with ROS2 themselves with a step-by-step guide on how to install
ROS2 on a Ubuntu system\footnote{The curl command from the guide does not work through the school proxy,
  but the command wget used instead does work. The key is then moved to the correct spot with mv}.
We will follow this guide here.

Firstly, we need to update the locals,  enable the universe Ubuntu repository, get the key and add the repository for ROS2. This can be done as follow:

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{verbatim}
locale  # check for UTF-8
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y locales
sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
locale  # verify settings
sudo apt install -y software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl wget
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/\
master/ros.key
sudo mv ros.key /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}


This is a one-liner to add the ROS2 repository:

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{verbatim}
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) \
signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] \
http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. \
/etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

It is then possible to install ROS2\footnote{This command installs a complete ``desktop'' version of ROS2. If space is a constraint, different, less complete packages can be install. Please refer to the official documentation about it.} as follow:

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{verbatim}
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y ros-humble-desktop \
ros-humble-ros-base \
python3-argcomplete \
ros-dev-tools
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

Once installed, it is possible to test the system with a provided example. You need to open two terminals and log wish SSH onto the board, then running respectively:

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{verbatim}
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}



\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{verbatim}
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}


You should be able to see the first terminal sending "Hello world" messages, and the second one receiving then.

\section{Vitis IDE}
\label{sec:vitis-ide}
This is the recommended IDE used to build software for the Xilinx boards.
It also include the tools to interact with the FPGA part, making the whole
software very large (>200GB).

The installer can be found on \href{Xilinx download page}{https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vitis.html}. You will need to get
a file named something like ``Xilinx\_Unified\_2022.2\_1014\_8888\_Lin64.bin''.

Vitis IDE installer is compatible with versions of Ubuntu, among other distributions,
but not officially yet for the 22.04 version.
Furthermore, the current install was tested on Pop OS, a distribution derived from Ubuntu.

This guide will present a guide that supposedly works for all distributions based on the newest
LTS from Ubuntu.

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{verbatim}
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev \
ncurses-term \
ncurses-base \
ncurses-bin \
libncurses5 \
libtinfo5 \
libncurses5-dev \
libncursesw5-dev
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

\href{Xilinx documentation about building a demo firmware}{https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/1837006921/OpenAMP+Base+Hardware+Configurations\#Build-RPU-firmware}

\subsection{Generating the platform configuration file}
\label{sec:gener-platf-conf}

\url{https://xilinx.github.io/kria-apps-docs/kv260/2022.1/build/html/docs/build_vitis_platform.html?highlight=xsa}

\url{https://github.com/Xilinx/kria-vitis-platforms}

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{verbatim}
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Xilinx/kria-vitis-platforms.git
cd kria-vitis-platforms/k26/platforms
export XILINX_VIVADO=/home/sunoc/Xilinx/Vivado/2022.2/
export XILINX_VITIS=/home/sunoc/Xilinx/Vitis/2022.2/
make platform PLATFORM=k26_base_starter_kit
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

Cmake, tcl and idn will become needed in order to build the firmware.
As discussed in a thread on \href{Xilinx community forum}{https://support.xilinx.com/s/question/0D52E00006jrzsYSAQ/platform-project-cannot-be-created-on-vitis?language=en\_US}, \verb|libidn11| is specifically required, but
creating a symbolic link from the current, 12 version works.
\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{verbatim}
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake tcl libidn11-dev libidn-dev libidn12 idn
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libidn.so.12 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libidn.so.11
